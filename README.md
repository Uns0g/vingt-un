# Vingt-Un | Twenty-One Game :two::one:
This is the first "original" project I've done with Javascript without any help or reference to follow.
The project is a Vingt-Un (blackjack) game, except for the fact that I created the rules.

## Rules :memo:

The rules are the following:
- The game starts with **10 cards on the table** and **3 cards to each player**.
- Whoever **reaches 21** in total cards value wins the game.
- If any player **reaches 17** or **has already taken 5** cards from the table, he cannot take any more cards from it.
- If both players have **17 or more** in total value of their cards **the one closest to 21** wins.
- If both players have **more than 21** in total value of their cards, the one **closest to 21 wins**.
- If **both players have the same value**, the game ends with a **draw** and nobody wins.
- If a player surrender the other wins.
- If a player stays a turn, the other may play if he is abiding by the above rules.
- Except in the case where **a player** chooses to stay or is prevented by another rule, he **must play all the turns the other plays**.

> You must have noticed that the code has a lot of ifs

## To Do :white_check_mark:

- [ ] Leave it up to the player to decide the limit of the total value of the cards, the maximum cards to be dealt and the number of cards that can be picked up from the table.
- [ ] Make the AI also choose between stopping and surrendering.
- [ ] Add some bet "system'.
- [ ] Make the AI accept or reject the limits that the player decides.
- [ ] Make the AI bet more or less than the player.
- [ ] Improve the design a little bit.
- [ ] Make the site responsive.
